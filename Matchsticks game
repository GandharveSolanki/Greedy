you solved this on your own the trick was start with the smallest test cases then dry run and try to find any kind of patterns

 value of n   ans
 1            1
 2            2
 3            3
 4            4
 5            -1
 6            1
 7            2
 8            3
 9            4
 10           -1
 
 so we see the pattern 
 approach- whenever the first player is given a choice the optimal way to play should be to give the opponent such number of sticks 
 left which is divisible by 5....why so...because 5 is such a number where if the opponent chooses any number but your win is decided...
 but if its opposite that you have 5 left or number divisible by 5 left then you will definitely lose. This is the main concept
 
 
 int matchGame(long long N) {
        // code here
        if(N%5==0)
        return -1;
        else
        return N%5;
    }

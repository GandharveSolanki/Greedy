//see man atleast fucking try to make a solution for 25 minutes dont be stupid and give up....
Okk so we have two rules

1.Each child must have at least one candy.
2.Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors. (left and right)


so to satify first condition i make an ans array where ans[i] will denote the no of candy the ith child will get so initially i will allocate 1 candy to each child to
satisfy the first condition .. because a child cannot have less than 1 candy
